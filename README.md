## Aternative Software(s)
If a computer no longer has ActivInspire on it, this is working list of alternatives for teacher to use.
- Integrated annotation tools within microsoft office
    - Word, Powerpoint, Etc ( Desktop versions )
- Easy Interactive Tools ( Intended for EPSON projectors, but works with Promethean HID devices. Can only use if software is on computer already, cannot install on newly image machine if not going to be used with epson hardware )
- Chrome annotation extensions
    - Page Marker
- Annotate PDFs using Microsoft Edge

## Multi Monitor Support
In order to support multiple monitors properly the promethean ActivDriver needs the pen to be set to tablet mode. Tablet mode will treat the display that the promethean board is on as the writing surface like a touch screen.

If the promethean software pen input is set to mouse mode, the touch input will get confused and control the mouse relative to its current position on screen. IF it is on the laptop screen and not the projector diplay for instance and the user tries to use the pen in the mode it will move around on the laptop screen.

gen1 / gen2 boards.
Due to driver signing and changes in windows 1903 only an unsigned, unsupported, driver could be a potential fix till boards are replaced.
